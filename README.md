# RESTORE
Graph Embedding evaluation benchmark
 A common benchmark for GE evaluation based on graph reconstruction from GE. Since the vector form of information become opaque and non-interpretable to human, it would be convincing if we can reconstruct the original graph from the GE. Such reconstruction will assert topology-information retain in a given vector form. Researchers use several kinds of graph in many application - directed graph, bidirectional graph, undirected graph, weighted graph, and knowledge graph. Therefore, which GE method â€“ HOPE, LINE, Node2Vec, SDNE, Graph2GNN etc is actually applicable for their particular problem is hard to assess beforehand.
